# Blog Generation Flask App

This project is a Flask-based web application that generates blog content using a Llama model via a subprocess. Users can input a prompt, and the app generates a blog post based on the given prompt.

## Features
- Simple web interface to input a blog prompt.
- Integration with the `llama3.2` model for generating blog content.
- JSON response with generated blog content.

## Requirements

### Python Packages
- Flask: `pip install Flask`

### Additional Tools
- `ollama` for running the `llama3.2` model (Ensure this is installed and accessible on your system).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/Parthibkarak71/blog-generation.git"
    cd BLOG_GENERATION
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

3. Ensure you have `ollama` installed to run the `llama3.2` model.

4. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5050` to access the application.
